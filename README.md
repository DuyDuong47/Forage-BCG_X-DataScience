# What is Forage?
Forage offers free, very short virtual work experiences, which are online programs designed and delivered by leading companies. Each virtual work experience contains a series of resources and tasks designed to simulate the real-world experience of starting a career.

To get started with the BCG Data Science Virtual Internship, Sign up for the BCG Data Science Virtual Internship on the [Forage website](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/Tcz8gTtprzAS4xSoK)

# BCG_X-DataScience
Welcome to the Data Science program! BCG X is transforming the businesses of today through data science and advanced analytics initiatives and our goal is to help companies generate competitive advantage through these initiatives.

# Task 1: Business Understanding & Hypothesis Framing
Understanding the business context and problem statement.
## Background information
PowerCo is a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to corporate, SME (Small & Medium Enterprise), and residential customers. The power liberalization of the energy market in Europe has led to significant customer churn, especially in the SME segment. They have partnered with BCG to help diagnose the source of churning SME customers.

A fair hypothesis is that price changes affect customer churn. Therefore, it is helpful to know which customers are more (or less) likely to churn at their current price, for which a good predictive model could be useful.

Moreover, for those customers that are at risk of churning, a discount might incentivize them to stay with our client. The head of the SME division is considering a 20% discount that is considered large enough to dissuade almost anyone from churning (especially those for whom price is the primary concern).

## Task
Your first task today is to understand what is going on with the client and to think about how you would approach this problem and test the specific hypothesis.

You must formulate the hypothesis as a data science problem and lay out the major steps needed to test this hypothesis. Communicate your thoughts and findings in an email to your AD, focusing on the data that you would need from the client and the analytical models you would use to test such a hypothesis.

# Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
Understanding the business through data
## Background information
The BCG project team thinks that building a churn model to understand whether price sensitivity is the largest driver of churn has potential. The client has sent over some data and the AD wants you to perform some exploratory data analysis.

## Task
Sub-Task 1:
Perform some exploratory data analysis. Look into the data types, data statistics, specific parameters, and variable distributions. This first subtask is for you to gain a holistic understanding of the dataset.

Sub-Task 2:
Verify the hypothesis of price sensitivity being to some extent correlated with churn. It is up to you to define price sensitivity and calculate it.

Sub-Task 3:
Prepare a half-page summary or slide of key findings and add some suggestions for data augmentation – which other sources of data should the client provide you with and which open-source datasets might be useful?

## Folder Task 2
This [folder](https://github.com/DuyDuong47/Forage-BCG_X-DataScience/tree/d2036ace5f065b82e46016e648f49a0971eb251d/Task%202%20-%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis) contains all the project files and resources for the BCG Data Science Virtual Internship Task 2.

# Task 3: Feature Engineering & Modelling
Uncovering signals within the data, predicting churn probability and evaluating model performance
## Background information
The team now has a good understanding of the data and feels confident to use the data to further understand the business problem. The team now needs to brainstorm and build out features to uncover signals in the data that could inform the churn model.

Feature engineering is one of the keys to unlocking predictive insight through mathematical modeling. Based on the data that is available and was cleaned, identify what you think could be drivers of churn for our client and build those features to later use in your model.

First focus on building on top of the feature that your colleague has already investigated: “the difference between off-peak prices in December and January the preceding year”. After this, if you have time, feel free to get creative with making any other features that you feel are worthwhile.

Once you have a set of features, you must train a Random Forest classifier to predict customer churn and evaluate the performance of the model with suitable evaluation metrics. Be rigorous with your approach and give full justification for any decisions made by yourself as the intern data scientist. 

Recall that the hypotheses under consideration is that churn is driven by the customers’ price sensitivities and that it would be possible to predict customers likely to churn using a predictive model.

If you’re eager to go the extra mile for the client, when you have a trained predictive model, remember to investigate the client’s proposed discounting strategy, with the head of the SME division suggesting that offering customers at high propensity to churn a 20% discount might be effective.

Build your models and test them while keeping in mind you would need data to prove/disprove the hypotheses, as well as to test the effect of a 20% discount on customers at a high propensity to churn.

## Task
Sub-Task 1
Your colleague has done some work on engineering the features within the cleaned dataset and has calculated a feature that seems to have predictive power. 
This feature is “the difference between off-peak prices in December and January the preceding year”.
Then try to think of ways to improve the feature’s predictive power and elaborate on why you made those choices.

Sub-Task 2
Now that you have a dataset of cleaned and engineered features, it is time to build a predictive model to see how well these features can predict customer churning. It is your task to train a Random Forest classifier and to evaluate the results properly. We would also like you to document the advantages and disadvantages of using a Random Forest for this use case.

# Task 4: Findings & Recommendations
Presenting your results and giving recommended actions to the client
